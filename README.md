🫀 Heart Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using several supervised machine learning models based on structured clinical data.

📊 Overview
The notebook performs the following tasks:

Data loading and basic preprocessing

Data splitting into training and testing sets

Model training and evaluation using common metrics

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
The following classification models were implemented:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📁 Dataset Features
Key features used include:

Age, Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Slope, Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no disease)

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

🧪 Libraries Used
pandas, numpy

sklearn (for ML models and metrics)
